Forecasting traffic flow is a crucial element of the advanced traffic control measures that can help alleviate traffic congestion. However, due to the non-linear relationship between traffic flow and congestion, a particular traffic flow can indicate either a congested or uncongested road condition. Therefore, relying solely on traffic flow prediction may not provide an accurate overall description of road traffic conditions. The collection comprises data and three modules:

1- Calculation of traffic fundamental diagram parameters
2- Classification of road congestion
3- Models for predicting traffic flow.
